  The Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) is a government
  corporation within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
  established in 1968 following the privatization of Fannie Mae. Its mission is
  to expand mortgage funding insured or guaranteed by federal agencies. By
  providing a full-faith-and-credit guarantee on securities backed by these
  mortgages, Ginnie Mae reduces investor risk and broadens the market for
  mortgage-backed securities.
